        <h3>So God does not exist and potency can reduce potency to act.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be. For a potential property does not actually exist, and therefore cannot cause a change. A red ball's potential to be blue cannot make itself to be blue without something that <i>actually</i> (e.g. blue paint). Nor can such potential cause change on another object. Thus, potency cannot reduce potency to act.</p>
