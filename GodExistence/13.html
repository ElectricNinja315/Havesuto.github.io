        <h3>So God does not exist and potency can be reduced to act by another act in a finite chain of movement that <i>must</i> end with an object with act but not potency.</h3>
        <p>We've arrived at what Thomas Aquinas calls <i>purus actus</i>, or pure act.</p>
        <p>Because this pure act cannot have any potential properties that differentiate it with something else with pure act, there can be only one pure act. Because there is only one pure act, all things are done through this pure act. Thus the pure act is <strong>omnipotent</strong>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, consider a poorly drawn triangle and a well drawn triangle. We say that the well drawn triangle <i>is</i> more of a triangle than the poorly drawn one, and thus has more being. We can also say that the well drawn triangle is a <i>better</i> or "more perfect" triangle. Thus, something is good or perfect only to the extent that it is actual, or <i>is</i>. Thus, the pure act is pure good, or <strong>omnibenevolent</strong>.</p>
        <p>In addition, because all material has potency, the pure act is immaterial. Furthermore, the more immaterial something is, the more knowledge it has. This is clear from the fact that having the form of something in the intellect allows us to understand it separated from its material form (thinking of a tree does not cause the mind to turn into a tree). Since the pure act is entirely immaterial, it must have all knowledge, being <strong>omniscent</strong>.</p>
