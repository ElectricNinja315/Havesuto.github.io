        <h3>So morality does not exist and humans do not have a final end, or nature.</h3>
        <p>On the contrary, it would appear that humans do have a final end, or nature. We are intrinsically ordered towards certain things like survival or social community. As a species, that is part of what being a human is. Therefore, it would appear that we do have a certain "human nature" or final end.</p>
