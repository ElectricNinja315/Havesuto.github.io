        <h3>So morality does not exist and humans have a final end, or nature, and something which fulfills its final end is not better than something that does not.</h3>
        <p>On the contrary, it appears that something which fulfills its final end is better than something that does not.</p>
        <p>Take for example a cup. A cup's final end, or nature, is to hold something, most likely a drink. If a cup has a hole in the bottom, or a crack on the side, it is considered to be a bad cup. The reason for this being that the cup can no longer effectively hold a drink in it. Therefore, we say that the cup is worse because it did not fulfill its final end.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it would appear that something which fulfills its final end is better than something which does not.</p>
