        <h3>So morality does not exist and humans have a final end, or nature, yet something is good to the extent that it fulfills its final end.</h3>
        <p>If something is good to the extent that it fulfills its final end, and humans have a final end, that means that one human can do something good or bad depending on if that thing fulfills its final end. That goodness or badness implies morality. Therefore, morality must exist.</p>
        <p>Thus we reach a contradiction.</p>
