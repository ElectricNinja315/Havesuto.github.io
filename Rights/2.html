        <h3>So rights exist yet there are only material things or science is the only way to find knowledge.</h3>
        <p>If only material things exist, then rights, which are an immaterial title, do not actually exist. Thus, there is a contradiction.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if science is the only way to find knowledge, since there are no experiments that can prove or disprove human rights (which again, are an immaterial title), then rights do not actually exist. This is a contradiction.</p>
