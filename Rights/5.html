        <h3>So human rights exist and the government or other people form an absolute authority.</h3>
        <p>There are three kinds of government that exist on earth: monarchy (rule under one), oligarchy (rule under a few), and democracy (rule under the people or multitude).</p>
        <p>The less popular argument is that the monarchy or oligarchy is perfect. However, there are multiple monarchs in the line of succession and there are multiple oligarchs. Throughout history, we see that the wills of different monarchs, even in the same country and line of succession, and the wills of different oligarchs, are extremely different. Thus these people cannot be an absolute authority.</p>
        <p>A more common argument is that the people as a whole form an absolute authority. Yet this cannot possibly be the case. Most people would not concede that slavery was justified, yet at one time the people believed that that was the case. Even the rare pro-slavery advocate would have to concede that when the people began to believe that slavery was not justified, they would not constitute absolute authority. Even if some argue that democracy has serious practical benefits, they cannot argue that it is an absolute authority because of this conflict.</p>
        <p>Thus, such an absolute authority cannot exist. If there be no absolute authority, who may proclaim human rights over all humanity? And we arrive at a contradiction.</p>
