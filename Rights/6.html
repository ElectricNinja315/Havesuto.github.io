        <h3>So human rights exist and there exists either a conflicting set of absolute authorities or no absolute authority.</h3>
        <p>If there is a set of conflicting absolute authorities, there is no authoritive declaration because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction">multiple conflicting declarations cannot possibly be true</a>.</p>
        <p>If there is no absolute authority, then there is no absolutely authoritively true declaration.</p>
        <p>If there be no absolutely authoritively true declaration, then who can proclaim a universal human right above all humans?</p>
