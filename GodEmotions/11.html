        <h3>So God has had only one emotion and does not change.</h3>
        <p>If he has only had one emotion, does it even make sense to call this state an emotion? For example, if God is always happy, it seems more correct to call this simply a product of his omnipotence and his nature rather than an emotion, which is a temporary state which can change easily. Therefore, we reach a possible contradiction.</p>
