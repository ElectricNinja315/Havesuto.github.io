        <h3>So God cannot have emotions yet Christianity is true.</h3>
        <p>If Christianity is indeed true, that means Jesus Christ was God. However, Jesus was a human and showed emotion as a human, such as his agony and sorrow before his crucifixion. If this is the case, that means God felt emotion in his human nature. Therefore, God can have emotion. Thus, we reach a contradiction.</p>
