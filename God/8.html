        <h3>So God does not exist and potency can reduce potency to act.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be. For a potencial property does not actually exist, and therefore cannot effect change. A red ball's potential to be blue cannot reduce itself to be blue without some act (e.g. blue paint). Nor can such potential effect change upon another existing object. Thus, potency cannot reduce potency to act.</p>
