        <h1>Proof for God's existence</h1>

        <h3>The First Way</h3>

        <h4>Proof</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>There exists act and potency. Act is the actual properties of a substance (a red rubber ball has the act of being bouncy and red). Potency is the potential properties of a substance (that same rubber ball has the potential to be blue if painted blue).</li>
            <li>Change can be thought of as the "reduction" of potency to act (painting the ball blue is the reduction of its potency to be blue to the act of being blue). This is also called "movement" in Thomism.</li>
            <li>Potency can be reduced to act by another act of the same kind only (the ball can only be painted blue by blue paint).</li>
            <li>An object cannot be in act and in potency in the same way (the ball cannot be both potentially and actually blue).</li>
            <li>By 3 and 4, potency can only be reduced by the act of another object.</li>
            <li>Assume there is no Unmoved Mover, which is purely act.</li>
            <li>Things are in motion.</li>
            <li>If something is in motion (changing) it must be being moved at that moment by some other object, which must be another moved mover which is made up of act and potency (because we are assuming there is no Unmoved Mover).</li>
            <li>That moved mover in turn must be being moved by another moved mover, in a chain of infinite regression.</li>
            <li>A chain of infinite regression cannot exist. Thus, there is a contradiction.</li>
            <li>By 6 and 10, the Unmoved Mover exists.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Common Objections to the First Way</h4>
        <h5>Can potency really only be reduced to act by another act of the same kind?</h5>
        <p>Yes, it must. The act which causes the reduction of potency to act must either have in itself the ability to cause the reduction virtually or eminently. Eminently is the most obvious way of possessing the ability. For example, if fire, which is actually hot, causes a piece of steel, which is potentially hot, to become hot, the fire eminently possessed the ability to make the steel hot. On the contrary, let's say I rub my hands together to make them hot. In doing so, I am creating friction between my hands. This ability to create friction, which is converted into heat, is an inherent property of my skin. Thus it can be said that my hands virtually contained the ability to create heat.</p>
        <h5>Are things really in motion as we speak?</h5>
        <p>Yes, they are. Even if you doubt your perception, you must acknowledge because you can see things changing that something within your experience is changing, which is itself a reduction of potency to act, and is therefore movement.</p>
        <h5>Why cannot there be a chain of infinite regression?</h5>
        <p>There are two ways of addressing this. Firstly, if there are a finite amount of things in the universe which can possibly affect an object (either because the universe is finite or because the expansion of the universe makes it impossible for some things to affect an object), then there cannot be an infinite number of movers. Secondly, even if there existed an infinite number of things, it doesn't make sense to say that if its handle is infinitely long that a paint brush can move itself. Obviously just because there are infinite movers that require something else to move it, does not mean that there is a reason that they could be in motion in the first place. Rather, there must be a painter, or something that moves on its own.</p>

        <h4>Additional Commentary</h4>
        <p>The First Way is a well known cosmological argument for God's existence. Note that it is not an argument based off of a gap in human understanding that we arbitrarily place God in, but is a logical proof starting with what we do know (that objects are in motion) and trying to figure out what must necessarily be there. All the First Way shows is that there is some Unmoved Mover of pure act, which we will demonstrate is God in the following proofs.</p>

        <h3>Necessary Properties of the Unmoved Mover</h3>

        <h4>Monotheism</h4>
        <p>The First Way leaves us with a necessary Unmoved Mover, which is purely act. Now something which is purely act cannot be multiple things. If there were multiple things that were pure act, they would have some potential qualities that would differentiate themselves from the other thing(s) of pure act. Now, a potential quality does not exist in something that is purely actual. Therefore, there can only be one thing of pure act, and thus only one Unmoved Mover.</p>

        <h4>Omnipotence</h4>
        <p>Since there is only one Unmoved Mover moving everything, it must be that every possible thing that can be done must be able to be done by that Unmoved Mover. Thus, we say that the Unmoved Mover is omnipotent.</p>
        <p>A common objection to omnipotence is Bertrand Russell's argument as a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox">Omnipotence Paradox</a>, which asks if God can create a stone that he cannot lift. If God can lift al stones, then there is something he cannot create. If God can create the stone, then he cannot lift it. However, notice that we said all <strong>possible</strong> things. Making a stone that an omnipotent being can lift is not a thing at all. In fact, it is a non-thing. Thus, it doesn't make sense to ask if such an action can be done by God, or anyone.</p>

        <h4>Omniscence</h4>
        <p>The following is taken from Aquinas' Fifth Way.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>There exist some abiotic things which move toward and end. For example, particles move toward each other not by chance, but consistently by physical law. Physical things accelerate at a rate not by chance, but in a way that fits physics equations.</li>
            <li>Something cannot move toward an end without intelligence.</li>
            <li>Abiotic things do not have intelligences.</li>
            <li>Some thing with intelligence must be moving the abiotic things.</li>
            <li>No biotic thing set particles into motion such that they would move toward each other or created their inherent ability to move in such a way that conforms with physical laws regarding velocity or acceleration.</li>
            <li>Some supremely intelligent being exists by which all such abiotic things are able to move towards an end.</li>
            <li>The only thing that can move all things accordingly is the Unmoved Mover (see "Omnipotence" above).</li>
            <li>The Unmoved Mover is also supremely intelligent.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Omnibenevolence</h4>
        <p>The classical and medieval philosophers had a category of qualites they called the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentals">"Transcendentals."</a> These Transcendentals are: beauty, nobility, goodness, truth, and being. It is at first difficult to see how they may be related, but let us take an example. Say I were to draw a very sloppy triangle and a near perfect triangle. We would say that we can attribute to the triangle beauty, nobility, goodness, truth, and being. It is beautiful and noble because of its aesthetic, it is a good triangle because it is well drawn, it is a true triangle because it is closer to perfection, and most importantly it IS a triangle moreso than the other one. On the other hand, the sloppy triangle is less of all these characteristics. It is less of a triangle than the other one. Here it is easy to see how beauty, nobility, goodness, truth, and being are all connected. On the other hand, something like evil is a non-thing, or a privation. It is a lack of being/beauty/nobility/goodness/truth.</p>
        <p>Seeing how these qualities are interchangeable, and knowing that God is that which is pure being, he must also be pure good. Thus, he is omnibenevolent.</p>
