        <h3>So God does not exist and potency can be reduced to act by another act in an infinitely regressing chain.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be.</p>
        <p>Firstly, science would suggest that only a finite amount of objects can effect a given object in such a chain. If one has an infinite amount of existing objects, one involves themselves in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel">paradoxes</a> that defy all logic. Accordingly, there can only be a finite amount of objects and so the chain of movement, which consists of actual objects, cannot be infinite.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, to suggest that something can move because an infinite number of moved movers (the wrist, muscles, etc.) are moving it is akin to saying that a paintbrush can move without a hand as long as the paintbrush is of infinite length. This is absurd.</p>
        <p>Thus, it would appear that the chain of movement cannot infinitely regress.</p>
